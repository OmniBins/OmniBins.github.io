Locked up by AppLocker? Stuck in a Kiosk? or just requiring that extra bit of stealth? OmniBins has a way out! or in I guess..

This project collects third-party binaries and libraries commonly found in business environments which can be leveraged to execute commands, manipulate files, bypass AppLocker and much more.
